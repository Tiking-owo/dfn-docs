# Tofu Brand Fan

The **Fursuit-specific Smart Fan** is a personalized cooling device tailor-made for furry fursuit wearers. It deeply integrates the special needs of fursuit usage scenarios, featuring all-around innovative design in cooling efficiency, operational convenience, and battery life experience.

## Design Philosophy

Our design revolves around three core principles: **Efficiency, Convenience, and Endurance**.
*   **Efficiency**: Utilizes a miniaturized nozzle and optimized airflow channel to concentrate airflow to the mouth area of the fursuit head for effective cooling.
*   **Convenience**: Large-sized buttons and a simplified UI design ensure easy blind operation even while wearing bulky fursuit paws (footpaws).
*   **Endurance**: The innovative quick-swap battery system eliminates the range anxiety associated with traditional built-in battery fans, ensuring uninterrupted cooling.

## Product Highlights

*   **Scenario-based Nozzle Design**: The small-diameter nozzle perfectly fits inside most fursuit head cavities, delivering airflow more precisely.
*   **Fursuit Paw-Friendly Controls**: Oversized physical buttons and clear screen feedback provide a hassle-free control experience.
*   **Unlimited Runtime Potential**: Supports hot-swappable battery replacement. With two batteries, you can achieve a "use one, charge one" cycle for continuous operation.
*   **Smart Interactive Screen**: Integrates a multi-function settings menu including wind speed, timer, and system settings, all displayed clearly.
*   **Sturdy and Lightweight Body**: The entire body is manufactured using 3D printing technology, achieving lightweight construction and personalization while ensuring structural strength.
